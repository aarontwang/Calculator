# Calculator

### Description

This project is a simple calculator that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The user can clear the display, and also use decimal points. If there is already one decimal point in the display, the calculator will prevent the user from adding another one. (e.g., 1.23 is acceptable, but the calculator will prevent 1.23.45) There is currently a rounding error in certain situations.
